# Input Hydro Extensions

## Purpose

This spec defines the optional extension files for the hydro subsystem: reservoir geometry, production function model selection, and pre-computed FPHA hyperplanes. These files augment the core hydro registry defined in [Input System Entities](input-system-entities.md) and live under `system/` in the input case directory.

For other system elements (pumping stations, energy contracts, non-controllable sources), see [Input System Entities](input-system-entities.md).
For deferred features (battery storage), see [Deferred Features](../06-deferred/deferred-features.md).

## 1. Hydro Geometry (`system/hydro_geometry.parquet`) — Optional

> **Format Rationale**
>
> **Entity-level lookup table** — Per-hydro tabular data (Volume-Height-Area curves) with multiple rows per hydro forming a static physical relationship. Parquet for typed columnar data with efficient per-hydro filtering.

Defines the Volume-Height-Area relationship for reservoirs. This data is used for:

- **Evaporation modeling**: Surface area as a function of storage determines evaporated volume (see evaporation coefficients in [Input System Entities §3](input-system-entities.md))
- **Forebay level**: Storage-to-height relationship for production function models that account for head variation (`linearized_head`, `fpha`)

Instead of polynomial fits, POWE.RS uses a tabular approach with linear interpolation — more transparent and easier to validate against surveyed data.

For the mathematical formulation of evaporation linearization and forebay level computation, see [Hydro Production Functions](../01-math/hydro-production-models.md) and [System Element Modeling](../01-math/system-elements.md).

## 2. Hydro Production Models (`system/hydro_production_models.json`) — Optional

> **Format Rationale**
>
> **Registry** — Small config selecting model type per hydro with nested optional params and stage/season configuration. JSON handles optional/nested structures well.

Configures the hydro production function (HPF) modeling approach per hydro. Different stages or seasons can use different accuracy levels. See [Hydro Production Functions](../01-math/hydro-production-models.md) for the mathematical formulation.

**Model Hierarchy** (increasing complexity and accuracy):

1. **`constant_productivity`**: Fixed productivity factor — single multiplication, fastest
2. **`linearized_head`**: Accounts for head variation with storage — requires geometry data. **Simulation-only** — excluded from training because the bilinear term changes the LP between iterations, breaking SDDP convergence (see [Hydro Production Models §3](../01-math/hydro-production-models.md))
3. **`fpha`**: Full piecewise-linear approximation via hyperplanes — most accurate

See [Hydro Production Functions §4](../01-math/hydro-production-models.md) for model selection guidelines and accuracy trade-offs.

**Default Behavior**: If this file is not provided or a hydro is not listed, the model uses the `generation.model` field from `hydros.json` for all stages.

### Selection Modes (Tagged Union)

The `selection_mode` field determines how the model is chosen per stage:

**Mode: `stage_ranges`** — Explicit stage ranges (structural changes across the horizon)

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://powers-rs.io/schemas/v2/production_models.schema.json",
  "production_models": [
    {
      "hydro_id": 0,
      "selection_mode": "stage_ranges",
      "stage_ranges": [
        {
          "start_stage_id": 0,
          "end_stage_id": 24,
          "model": "fpha",
          "fpha_config": {
            "source": "computed",
            "volume_discretization_points": 7,
            "turbine_discretization_points": 15,
            "fitting_window": {
              "volume_min_hm3": null,
              "volume_max_hm3": null
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "start_stage_id": 25,
          "end_stage_id": null,
          "model": "constant_productivity"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Mode: `seasonal`** — Model selection keyed by season index, cycling across the horizon

Each stage is mapped to its season via the stage-to-season mapping defined in `stages.json` (see [Input Scenarios](input-scenarios.md)). For a monthly study, seasons 0–11 correspond to January–December. This mode is useful for studies where accuracy requirements vary cyclically (e.g., wet season uses FPHA, dry season uses linearized head).

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://powers-rs.io/schemas/v2/production_models.schema.json",
  "production_models": [
    {
      "hydro_id": 5,
      "selection_mode": "seasonal",
      "default_model": "linearized_head",
      "seasons": [
        {
          "season_id": 0,
          "model": "fpha",
          "fpha_config": {
            "source": "computed",
            "volume_discretization_points": 5,
            "turbine_discretization_points": 10
          }
        },
        {
          "season_id": 1,
          "model": "fpha",
          "fpha_config": {
            "source": "computed",
            "volume_discretization_points": 5,
            "turbine_discretization_points": 10
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, seasons 0 and 1 (e.g., January and February — wet season) use FPHA; all other seasons fall back to `default_model` (linearized head).

> **Note**: This example uses `linearized_head` as the default model, which restricts this hydro's configuration to **simulation only**. For training, replace the `default_model` with `constant_productivity` or `fpha`. See [Hydro Production Models §3](../01-math/hydro-production-models.md).

**Combined usage**: Different hydros in the same file can use different selection modes. Stage ranges and seasonal modes can coexist across hydros but not within a single hydro.

| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| `constant_productivity` | `productivity_mw_per_m3s`  | ✗                | ✗                  |
| `linearized_head`       | `productivity_mw_per_m3s`  | ✓                | ✗                  |
| `fpha` (computed)       | `productivity_mw_per_m3s`¹ | ✓                | ✗                  |

¹ Used as fallback for stages without FPHA configuration.

> **Note**: For computed FPHA, the solver also uses the optional `tailrace`, `hydraulic_losses`, and `efficiency` fields from the hydro object in `hydros.json` (see [Input System Entities §3](input-system-entities.md)). If these fields are omitted, fallback assumptions apply (no tailrace adjustment, zero losses, efficiency derived from productivity).

## 3. FPHA Hyperplanes (`system/fpha_hyperplanes.parquet`) — Optional

> **Format Rationale**
>
> **Pre-computed coefficient table** — Per-hydro tabular data with many rows of hyperplane coefficients, potentially varying by stage. Parquet for typed columnar data with efficient per-hydro filtering.

Pre-computed FPHA hyperplane coefficients for hydro production function modeling. Allows using externally-fitted planes instead of computing them at runtime. Different stages can have different plane sets per hydro (e.g., near-term fitting with more detail vs. far-term with fewer planes).

| Use Case                 | Description                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Legacy system migration  | Import FPHA coefficients from DECOMP/DESSEM input files |
| External calibration     | Use coefficients fitted by specialized tools            |
| Performance optimization | Skip runtime fitting for large systems                  |

If not provided, POWE.RS computes hyperplanes from `hydro_geometry` data and the hydro object's tailrace/losses/efficiency fields during preprocessing.

### Validation

| Rule            | Description                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Minimum planes  | Each `hydro_id` (per `stage_id`) should have at least 3 planes                 |
| Typical range   | 5–30 planes per hydro per stage                                                |
| `gamma_v`       | Should be positive (higher storage → higher generation)                        |
| `gamma_q`       | Should be positive (more flow → more generation)                               |
| `gamma_s`       | Should be negative or zero (spillage reduces effective head)                   |
| Validity ranges | If provided, planes are only activated when hydro is within range              |
| Stage coverage  | If `stage_id` is used, stages without specific planes fall back to `null` rows |
