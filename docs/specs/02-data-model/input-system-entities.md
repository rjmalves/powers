# Input System Entities

## Purpose

This spec defines the JSON schemas for all system entity registries. These files live under `system/` in the input case directory and define the physical model that the optimizer operates on.

The following system elements are defined here:

| Section | Entity                   | File                                   | Status   |
| ------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------- |
| §1      | Buses                    | `system/buses.json`                    | Active   |
| §2      | Transmission Lines       | `system/lines.json`                    | Active   |
| §3      | Hydro Plants             | `system/hydros.json`                   | Active   |
| §4      | Thermal Plants           | `system/thermals.json`                 | Active   |
| §5      | Pumping Stations         | `system/pumping_stations.json`         | Active   |
| §6      | Import/Export Contracts  | `system/energy_contracts.json`         | Active   |
| §7      | Non-Controllable Sources | `system/non_controllable_sources.json` | Deferred |

For the overall directory layout and configuration, see [Input Directory Structure](input-directory-structure.md).

## 1. Buses (`system/buses.json`)

> **Order Invariance**: The order of buses in this array does NOT affect results. After loading, all buses are sorted by `id`. See [Design Principles §3](../00-overview/design-principles.md).

### Concept

A **bus** represents a node in the electrical network where energy balance must be maintained. Buses are a general network modeling concept — they can represent regional subsystems (as in the Brazilian SIN with 4 regions), individual substations, or any aggregation level suitable for the study. The number of buses can range from a handful for regional studies to hundreds or thousands for more detailed network representations.

> **Format Rationale — buses.json**
>
> Buses are a set of entities with cross-references (lines, hydros, and thermals all reference a `bus_id`). JSON is a natural fit for registry data: each entity is a structured object with a unique ID.

### Deficit Modeling

Deficit is modeled as piecewise linear segments. Each segment specifies a depth (MW of unmet demand) and cost. Segments are cumulative: first `depth_mw` MW at first cost, next `depth_mw` MW at second cost, etc. The last segment with `depth_mw: null` extends to infinity (required for LP feasibility).

Deficit is a **recourse slack** in the [Penalty System](penalty-system.md) — it ensures LP feasibility when demand cannot be met. The deficit cost represents the value of lost load and must be high enough to make load shedding a last resort. See [Penalty System §2, Category 1](penalty-system.md) for the role of deficit in the penalty taxonomy and appropriate cost ranges.

Global deficit defaults are defined in `penalties.json`; entity-level overrides are defined inline here.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://powers-rs.io/schemas/v2/buses.schema.json",
  "buses": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "name": "SUDESTE",
      "deficit_segments": [
        { "depth_mw": 1000, "cost": 2000.0 },
        { "depth_mw": 2000, "cost": 5000.0 },
        { "depth_mw": null, "cost": 10000.0 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "SUL"
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Note on Bus 1 (SUL)**: No `deficit_segments` defined — uses global default from `penalties.json`.

### Bus Fields

| Field              | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`               | i32    | Yes      | Unique bus identifier                                                                                                               |
| `name`             | string | Yes      | Human-readable bus name                                                                                                             |
| `deficit_segments` | array  | No       | Piecewise deficit cost segments (uses global default from `penalties.json` if omitted). See [Penalty System](penalty-system.md) §3. |

### Deficit Segment Fields

| Field      | Type        | Required | Description                                                       |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `depth_mw` | f64 \| null | Yes      | MW of deficit at this segment (`null` for final infinite segment) |
| `cost`     | f64         | Yes      | Cost per MWh of deficit in this segment                           |

For the mathematical formulation of bus load balance constraints and deficit variables, see [System Element Modeling](../01-math/system-elements.md).

## 2. Lines (`system/lines.json`)

> **Order Invariance**: The order of lines in this array does NOT affect results. After loading, all lines are sorted by `id`. See [Design Principles §3](../00-overview/design-principles.md).

### Concept

A **transmission line** represents an interconnection between two buses, allowing bidirectional power transfer subject to capacity limits and transmission losses. The number of lines scales with the number of buses — detailed network representations may have hundreds of lines.

> **Format Rationale — lines.json**
>
> Lines are entity definitions referencing buses. Each line connects exactly two buses and has capacity, cost, and lifecycle attributes. JSON is a natural fit because each line is a self-contained structured object with cross-references to bus IDs.

### Exchange Cost

The `exchange_cost` field is a **regularization cost** as defined in [Penalty System §2, Category 3](penalty-system.md). It discourages unnecessary power flow between buses, preventing degenerate solutions with power circulation. It is NOT a violation penalty — line capacity bounds are hard constraints without slack variables (see [Penalty System §4](penalty-system.md)). Default is defined in `penalties.json`.

### Line Operative States

| State            | Condition                                    | LP Variables              |

| `operating`      | Between `entry_stage_id` and `exit_stage_id` | direct_flow, reverse_flow |
| `decommissioned` | After `exit_stage_id`                        | None (buses isolated)     |

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://powers-rs.io/schemas/v2/lines.schema.json",
  "lines": [
    {
      "id": 0,

    }
  ]
}
```

| `entry_stage_id`      | i32 \| null | No       | null    | Stage when line enters service (`null` = always exists)                                                                                   |

## 3. Hydro Registry (`system/hydros.json`) — Core Schema

> **Order Invariance**: The order of hydros in this array does NOT affect results. After loading, hydros are sorted by `id`. See [Design Principles §3](../00-overview/design-principles.md).

> **Format Rationale — hydros.json**
>
> Hydro plants are complex entities with many optional nested fields: reservoir bounds, outflow limits, generation model selection, diversion channels, filling configuration, and optional penalty overrides. JSON handles optional/nested structures well — absent fields use defaults, and the hierarchical layout mirrors the physical structure of the plant.

### Hydro Operative States

| State            | Condition                                                 | LP Variables                                                                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `non_existing`   | Before filling or entry (no filling defined)              | See open question below                                                                    |
| `filling`        | Between `filling.start_stage_id` and `entry_stage_id - 1` | storage, outflow (=spillage), violation slacks, evaporation                                |
| `operating`      | Between `entry_stage_id` and `exit_stage_id`              | storage, turbined, spillage, diversion, outflow, generation, evaporation, violation slacks |
| `decommissioned` | After `exit_stage_id`                                     | See open question below                                                                    |

> **Dead-volume filling**: During filling stages, the reservoir accumulates water. `turbined_flow = 0` (hard constraint), and all released water goes through spillways/bottom gates. Environmental flow must be met via spillage.
>
> **Cascade redirection**: The `downstream_id` always refers to the physical downstream plant. During stages when the downstream plant doesn't exist, outflows are automatically redirected to the next operating downstream in the cascade.
>
> **Penalties**: Penalty defaults are defined in `penalties.json`. Entity-level overrides can be specified in an optional `penalties` block in the hydro definition. Stage-varying overrides use the stage override mechanism (format TBD). See [Penalty System](penalty-system.md).

> **Open Question — LP behavior for non-existing and decommissioned hydros**: When a hydro is `non_existing` or `decommissioned`, the treatment of its LP variables and constraints is not fully defined. Key questions:
>
> - **Decommissioned**: What happens to water stored in the reservoir? Should storage variables remain (with no generation constraints) to allow water to pass through the cascade? Should all constraints be removed except the water balance?
> - **Non-existing**: Should constraints associated with the hydro (e.g., water balance for cascade neighbors that reference it) be active before the plant begins filling?
> - **LP shape regularity**: Is it preferable to keep the LP structure uniform across all stages (adding zero-bounded variables for non-existing elements) for implementation simplicity, or dynamically add/remove variables per stage?
>
> **Resolution**: This is a behavioral/semantic question that affects the LP formulation. Flagged for resolution during P2 math spec reviews (`system-elements.md`, `lp-formulation.md`).

### Generation Model (Tagged Union)

The `generation` object uses a tagged union pattern: the `model` field selects the variant, and only fields relevant to that variant are required. This ensures strict validation per model type.

**Variant: `constant_productivity`**

```json
{
  "generation": {
    "model": "constant_productivity",
    "productivity_mw_per_m3s": 0.8765,
    "min_turbined_m3s": 0.0,
    "max_turbined_m3s": 1692.0,
    "min_generation_mw": 0.0,
    "max_generation_mw": 1312.0
  }
}
```

| Field                     | Type | Required | Description                              |
| ------------------------- | ---- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `model`                   | str  | Yes      | Must be `"constant_productivity"`        |
| `productivity_mw_per_m3s` | f64  | Yes      | Constant productivity factor [MW/(m³/s)] |
| `min_turbined_m3s`        | f64  | Yes      | Minimum turbined flow (machine limits)   |
| `max_turbined_m3s`        | f64  | Yes      | Maximum turbined flow (machine capacity) |
| `min_generation_mw`       | f64  | Yes      | Minimum generation bound (user-defined)  |
| `max_generation_mw`       | f64  | Yes      | Maximum generation bound (user-defined)  |

**Variant: `linearized_head`**

```json
{
  "generation": {
    "model": "linearized_head",
    "productivity_mw_per_m3s": 0.8765,
    "min_turbined_m3s": 0.0,
    "max_turbined_m3s": 1692.0,
    "min_generation_mw": 0.0,
    "max_generation_mw": 1312.0
  }
}
```

| Field                     | Type | Required | Description                                        |
| ------------------------- | ---- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `model`                   | str  | Yes      | Must be `"linearized_head"`                        |
| `productivity_mw_per_m3s` | f64  | Yes      | Base productivity (adjusted by head linearization) |
| `min_turbined_m3s`        | f64  | Yes      | Minimum turbined flow                              |
| `max_turbined_m3s`        | f64  | Yes      | Maximum turbined flow                              |
| `min_generation_mw`       | f64  | Yes      | Minimum generation bound (user-defined)            |
| `max_generation_mw`       | f64  | Yes      | Maximum generation bound (user-defined)            |

Requires `hydro_geometry` data (see [Input Hydro Extensions](input-hydro-extensions.md)).

**Variant: `fpha`**

```json
{
  "generation": {
    "model": "fpha",
    "min_turbined_m3s": 0.0,
    "max_turbined_m3s": 1692.0,
    "min_generation_mw": 0.0,
    "max_generation_mw": 1312.0
  }
}
```

| Field               | Type | Required | Description                             |
| ------------------- | ---- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `model`             | str  | Yes      | Must be `"fpha"`                        |
| `min_turbined_m3s`  | f64  | Yes      | Minimum turbined flow                   |
| `max_turbined_m3s`  | f64  | Yes      | Maximum turbined flow                   |
| `min_generation_mw` | f64  | Yes      | Minimum generation bound (user-defined) |
| `max_generation_mw` | f64  | Yes      | Maximum generation bound (user-defined) |

Note: `productivity_mw_per_m3s` is NOT required for `fpha` — the production function is defined entirely by the hyperplane coefficients. FPHA configuration (computed vs. precomputed, discretization parameters) is specified in the production models extension file. See [Input Hydro Extensions](input-hydro-extensions.md).

> **Generation bounds**: Both `min_generation_mw` and `max_generation_mw` are mandatory user-defined values. They are NOT derived from turbined flow bounds because the production function varies by model and may not be a simple linear relationship. See [Penalty System §7](penalty-system.md) for how generation bounds interact with violation slacks.

> \* Required when `filling` is not null. `filling_inflow_m3s` is optional (defaults to 0.0 — passive filling from natural inflows only). \*\* Required when `diversion` is not null.

### Diversion Channel

Diversion creates an additional flow variable `diversion_flow` bounded by `[0, max_flow_m3s]`. Diverted water is subtracted from the plant's balance and added to `diversion.downstream_id`'s inflow. It does NOT generate power. The `diversion_cost` is a **regularization cost** (see [Penalty System §2, Category 3](penalty-system.md)) that incentivizes keeping water in the main cascade.

### Filling Model

Dead-volume filling represents the commissioning period of a new hydro plant, during which the reservoir is being filled from an initial level (potentially zero) up to the dead volume (`min_storage_hm3`). This design is based on CEPEL's dead-volume filling model (`enchimento de volume morto`).

**Timeline**:

```
[start_stage_id]──── filling period ────[entry_stage_id]──── operating ────[exit_stage_id]
     enchendo                                operando
```

- Before `start_stage_id`: hydro does not exist
- `[start_stage_id, entry_stage_id)`: filling — storage can be below `min_storage_hm3`, no generation
- `[entry_stage_id, exit_stage_id)`: operating — normal constraints, generation active
- After `exit_stage_id`: decommissioned

**Filling target**: Always `min_storage_hm3`. The purpose of filling is to reach the dead volume so the hydro can begin operating. There is no user-configurable target — it is always the reservoir's minimum storage.

**Filling behavior**: During the filling period, the filling inflow determines the water retained for filling per stage. The entity-level `filling_inflow_m3s` provides a default value for all filling stages; per-stage overrides in `hydro_bounds` (see [Input Constraints §2](input-constraints.md)) replace it for specific stages. If neither is specified, filling inflow is 0.0 (passive filling — the reservoir fills only from natural stochastic inflows). The hydro has no generation (`turbined_flow = 0`, `generation = 0`). Outflow during filling is limited to spillage (once water reaches the spillway crest). See [Penalty System §7](penalty-system.md) for how filling interacts with outflow requirements, terminal filling constraints, and the penalty hierarchy.

> **Deferred: Bottom discharge** (`descargas de fundo`). CEPEL models bottom discharge outlets that allow water release when the reservoir level is below the spillway crest. This creates a conditional constraint (outflow capacity depends on whether the reservoir level is above/below the spillway crest), which requires either nonlinear or binary constraints — incompatible with LP-based SDDP. Bottom discharge is deferred to the simulation step only.

**Initial conditions**: Filling hydros use a separate `filling_storage` array in `initial_conditions.json` (see [Input Constraints §1](input-constraints.md)) because their initial volume can be below `min_storage_hm3`.

**Validation**: `start_stage_id` must be strictly less than `entry_stage_id`. If `entry_stage_id` is null, filling config is invalid (a filling hydro must eventually begin operating).

### Tailrace Model (Tagged Union) — Optional

Defines the downstream water level as a function of total outflow (turbined + spillage). Used by `linearized_head` and `fpha` (computed) models to determine net head.

**Variant: `polynomial`** — Tailrace level as polynomial function of outflow: `h_tail(Q_out) = c₀ + c₁·Q + c₂·Q² + ...`

| Field          | Type  | Required | Description                                                   |
| -------------- | ----- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`         | str   | Yes      | Must be `"polynomial"`                                        |
| `coefficients` | [f64] | Yes      | Polynomial coefficients `[c₀, c₁, c₂, ...]` (ascending order) |

**Variant: `piecewise`** — Tailrace level as piecewise-linear function defined by (outflow, height) points with linear interpolation.

| Field    | Type                                    | Required | Description                                                                     |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`   | str                                     | Yes      | Must be `"piecewise"`                                                           |
| `points` | [{`outflow_m3s`: f64, `height_m`: f64}] | Yes      | Points defining the curve (must be sorted by outflow, monotonically increasing) |

**Fallback**: If `tailrace` is omitted, no tailrace adjustment is applied (only relevant for `linearized_head` and computed `fpha`).

### Hydraulic Losses Model (Tagged Union) — Optional

Defines head losses in the hydraulic circuit (intake, penstock, draft tube).

**Variant: `factor`** — Losses as a fraction (p.u.) of gross head: `h_loss = value × h_gross`

| Field   | Type | Required | Description                                             |
| ------- | ---- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`  | str  | Yes      | Must be `"factor"`                                      |
| `value` | f64  | Yes      | Loss factor in per-unit (e.g., 0.03 = 3% of gross head) |

**Variant: `constant`** — Fixed head loss in meters, independent of operating point.

| Field     | Type | Required | Description                  |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| `type`    | str  | Yes      | Must be `"constant"`         |
| `value_m` | f64  | Yes      | Constant head loss in meters |

**Fallback**: If `hydraulic_losses` is omitted, zero losses are assumed.

### Efficiency Model (Tagged Union) — Optional

Defines turbine-generator efficiency for production function computation.

**Variant: `constant`** — Single efficiency value across all operating points.

| Field   | Type | Required | Description                                 |
| ------- | ---- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `type`  | str  | Yes      | Must be `"constant"`                        |
| `value` | f64  | Yes      | Efficiency as a fraction (e.g., 0.92 = 92%) |

> **Future Variant**: `flow_dependent` — efficiency as a function of turbined flow. Not yet implemented.

**Fallback**: If `efficiency` is omitted, efficiency is implicitly embedded in `productivity_mw_per_m3s` (i.e., the productivity factor already accounts for average efficiency).

### Evaporation Coefficients — Optional

Defines monthly evaporation rates for the reservoir. The solver interpolates these 12 values based on the stage's date/season mapping to determine the evaporation rate for each stage. Combined with surface area from `hydro_geometry` (see [Input Hydro Extensions §1](input-hydro-extensions.md)), this determines evaporated volume.

| Field             | Type      | Required | Description                                              |
| ----------------- | --------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `coefficients_mm` | [f64; 12] | Yes      | Monthly evaporation depth (mm), January through December |

**Fallback**: If `evaporation` is omitted, no evaporation is modeled for this hydro.

For the mathematical formulation of evaporation linearization, see [System Element Modeling](../01-math/system-elements.md) and [Hydro Production Functions](../01-math/hydro-production-models.md).

### Hydro Extensions

The following extension files augment the core hydro registry with additional data. They are documented in [Input Hydro Extensions](input-hydro-extensions.md):

| Data              | Purpose                                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Hydro geometry    | Volume-Height-Area relationship for evaporation |
| Production models | Stage-dependent production model selection      |
| FPHA hyperplanes  | Pre-computed FPHA hyperplane coefficients       |

> **Note on inflow models**: Inflow models are defined per hydro per stage in the scenarios directory, linked by `hydro_id`. See [Input Scenarios](input-scenarios.md). The file format for inflow model data is subject to the broader format discussion (see [Input Directory Structure](input-directory-structure.md)).

> **Future Extension — Generating Units**: The current schema defines generation capacity at the plant level (aggregate min/max turbined flow and generation bounds). A future enhancement may introduce a `units` field containing individual generating unit specifications (nominal power, turbined flow at nominal power, unit count, efficiency curves per unit). This would enable more accurate production function modeling and unit-level dispatch constraints.

> **Future Extension — CEPEL Advanced Flow Modeling**: Analysis of CEPEL documentation identified three potential input schema extensions that may be needed for more detailed hydro modeling. These are flagged for resolution during P2 math spec reviews:
>
> 1. **Lateral flow sources** (`Q_lat`): Some plants (e.g., Belo Monte/Pimental, Itaipu) receive lateral flows from river gauging posts or other plants' outflows that affect the tailwater level and production function. This would require a new field to specify lateral flow sources (e.g., `lateral_flow_sources: [{type, id}]`) and potentially a new flow variable in the LP.
> 2. **Downstream flow participation factors** (`Q_jus`): The downstream flow can include participation factors (`k_jus^Q`, `k_jus^S`, `k_jus^qa`, `k_jus^qd`) for turbined flow, spillage, lateral post inflows, and other plants' outflows. Our current `o = q + s` is the simplest case (all factors = 1.0). This would require a new `downstream_flow_factors` object in the hydro schema.
> 3. **Water travel time propagation curves**: Beyond simple translation delay (`τ_ij` implicit in `downstream_id`), CEPEL supports propagation curves where outflow arrives fractionally over `[τ_min, τ_max]` with participation percentages. This would require a `travel_time` configuration object (e.g., `{type: "simple", delay_stages: N}` or `{type: "propagation_curve", segments: [{delay, fraction}]}`), plus special end-of-horizon handling for water in transit.

## 4. Thermal Registry (`system/thermals.json`)

> **Order Invariance**: The order of thermals in this array does NOT affect results. After loading, thermals are sorted by `id`. See [Design Principles §3](../00-overview/design-principles.md).

> **Format Rationale — thermals.json**
>
> Thermal plants are entity definitions with cost curve nesting. Each thermal has a piecewise-linear cost curve represented as an array of `cost_segments`, plus generation bounds and lifecycle attributes. JSON is a natural fit because cost curves are naturally nested arrays within each plant object.

> **Note**: Use `entry_stage_id` and `exit_stage_id` to model plants entering or exiting the system. Alternatively, stage-varying bounds can set generation to 0 for stages where the plant is offline (see [Input Constraints](input-constraints.md) for stage-varying override mechanisms; file format TBD).

### Thermal Fields

| Field                          | Type           | Required | Description                                             |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                           | i32            | Yes      | Unique thermal identifier                               |

| `bus_id`                       | i32            | Yes      | Bus where generation is injected                        |
| `entry_stage_id`               | i32 \| null    | No       | Stage when thermal enters service (`null` = always)     |
| `exit_stage_id`                | i32 \| null    | No       | Stage when thermal is decommissioned (`null` = never)   |

> **Thermal bounds**: Generation bounds (`min_mw`, `max_mw`) are hard constraints — no slack variables. Thermal dispatch is directly controllable (unlike hydro which depends on exogenous inflows), so if bounds cannot be met, this indicates a data error. See [Penalty System §4](penalty-system.md).
>
> **Stage-varying bounds**: Stage-varying thermal generation bounds can override the base values from `thermals.json`. The logical schema requires fields for `thermal_id`, `stage_id`, `min_generation_mw`, and `max_generation_mw` (nullable for partial overrides). The file format for stage-varying bounds is subject to the broader format discussion — see [Input Directory Structure](input-directory-structure.md).

### GNL Thermal Plants (Deferred)

> **Implementation Status**: Data model is ready. Implementation is planned but not yet complete.

GNL (Gas Natural Liquefeito) plants require **dispatch anticipation**: the dispatch decision must be made N stages ahead due to fuel ordering lead times. This creates additional state variables.

```json
{
  "id": 10,
  "name": "GNL_PLANT",
  "bus_id": 2,
  "gnl_config": {
    "lag_stages": 2
  },
  "cost_segments": [{ "capacity_mw": 500.0, "cost_per_mwh": 200.0 }],
  "generation": {
    "min_mw": 0.0,
    "max_mw": 500.0
  }
}
```

| Field                   | Type           | Description                                                 |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gnl_config`            | object \| null | GNL configuration. If null or omitted, thermal is standard. |
| `gnl_config.lag_stages` | i32            | Number of stages ahead for dispatch decision.               |

When configured, the algorithm adds state variables for the committed dispatch pipeline:

| State Variable                   | Description                      |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `gnl_committed[thermal_id, t+1]` | Dispatch committed for stage t+1 |
| `gnl_committed[thermal_id, t+2]` | Dispatch committed for stage t+2 |
| ...                              | ... up to `lag_stages` ahead     |

Initial values for the GNL pipeline are specified in `initial_conditions.json`.

For the mathematical formulation of thermal cost curves and generation constraints, see [System Element Modeling](../01-math/system-elements.md).

## 5. Pumping Stations (`system/pumping_stations.json`) — Optional

> **Order Invariance**: The order of pumping stations in this array does NOT affect results. After loading, all stations are sorted by `id`. See [Design Principles §3](../00-overview/design-principles.md).

> **Format Rationale — pumping_stations.json**
>
> Small set of pump-turbine coupling definitions with cross-references to hydros and buses. JSON is natural for structured entities with unique IDs.

Pumping stations transfer water from a source reservoir to a destination reservoir, consuming electrical power. They are independent system elements — not a property of any specific hydro plant.

| Application             | Description                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pumped hydro storage    | Store energy by pumping water to upper reservoir during low-demand periods     |
| Inter-basin transfers   | Move water between river basins for irrigation or energy optimization          |
| Reversible hydro plants | Plants that can both generate and pump (model as hydro + pumping station pair) |

### Pumping Station Operative States

| State            | Condition                                    | LP Variables                   |

| `decommissioned` | After `exit_stage_id`                        | None                           |

> **Cost note**: Pumping stations do **not** have a direct cost term in the objective function. The cost of pumping is implicitly captured through the energy consumed at the connected bus — pumping power appears as additional load in the bus energy balance. See [Penalty System §8](penalty-system.md) for details.

For the mathematical formulation of pumping constraints and water balance impact, see [System Element Modeling §7](../01-math/system-elements.md).

## 6. Energy Contracts (`system/energy_contracts.json`) — Optional

> **Order Invariance**: The order of contracts in this array does NOT affect results. After loading, all contracts are sorted by `id`. See [Design Principles §3](../00-overview/design-principles.md).

> **Format Rationale — energy_contracts.json**
>
> Contract definitions with nested structure and cross-references to buses. JSON is natural for structured entities with unique IDs.

Energy contracts represent agreements to buy (import) or sell (export) electricity with external systems (neighboring countries, bilateral agreements). Import adds to supply; export adds to demand in the bus load balance.

| `decommissioned` | After `exit_stage_id`                        | None                 |

### Contract Fields

> **Stage-varying bounds**: Contract limits and prices can be overridden per stage. The logical schema requires fields for `contract_id`, `stage_id`, `min_mw`, `max_mw`, and `price_per_mwh` (all nullable for partial overrides). The file format is subject to the broader format discussion — see [Input Directory Structure](input-directory-structure.md).

## 7. Non-Controllable Generation Sources — Deferred

> **Implementation Status**: Planned but not yet implemented. See [Deferred Features](../06-deferred/deferred-features.md).

Non-controllable sources include wind farms, solar plants, and other intermittent generation whose output depends on weather conditions rather than dispatch decisions. These sources have stochastic availability, near-zero marginal cost, and a curtailment option.

When implemented, this section will define the registry schema for `system/non_controllable_sources.json`, including:

- Source identification and bus connection
- Installed capacity and availability model reference
- Curtailment penalty (a **regularization penalty** — see [Penalty System §2, Category 2](penalty-system.md))
- Lifecycle management (`entry_stage_id`, `exit_stage_id`)

For the planned mathematical formulation, see [System Element Modeling §6](../01-math/system-elements.md).
